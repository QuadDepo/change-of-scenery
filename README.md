# Change of Scenery

This app lets you quickly and easily change your desktop background image to something much cooler than whatever it currently is.

### Technologies and resources used:

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io) - A framework for building cross-platform applications with web technologies. Electron is pretty sweet.

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Neither of us had ever used Vue and we got extra credit for using a new, non-React thing for the front-end. Plus learning and developing opinions about new frameworks is always nice, probably.

[Applescripts](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-applescript) - We used this npm module to let us do applescript stuff with JS. The novelty of writing straight-up English to our computer wore off pretty quickly, because English syntax makes way less sense than most programming languages.

[Unsplash.](https://unsplash.com/) - Our favorite place on the internet for finding SUPER high quality images. If you've never been there, stop reading this now and go check it out. It's a super cool place. All the pictures are licensed under Creative Commons 0, which means they're free to use for whatever.  

[Electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) - We only had a week to do this project (less, actually, because Brett selfishly left two days before it was due to fly across the country to try and convince someone to give him a job,) so we used this boilerplate that already had Vue and Electron all wired up so we could just start writing code as quickly as possible.

### For development:
Clone down the [repo](https://github.com/swanie21/change-of-scenery.git)

```
npm install
```
To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

To run the test suite:

```
npm test
```  

Changes in the code won't show up while the app is running, so just close it and restart it to see whatever you changed. That's pretty much it, really.
